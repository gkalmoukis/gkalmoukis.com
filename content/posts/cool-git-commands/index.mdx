#### Squash a series of commits and rewrite the history by writing them as one.

```
git rebase -i
```

this gives you an interactive rebasing tool.

Type `s` to apply squash to a commit with the previous one. Repeat the `s` as many times you need.

#### Take a commit that lives in a separate branch and apply the same changes on the current branch

single commit:

```
git cherry-pick <commit>
```

for multiple commits:

```
git cherry-pick <commit1> <commit2> <commit3>
```

#### Restore the status of a file to the last commit (revert changes)
```
git checkout -- <filename>
```

#### Show a graph of the commit history
```
git log --pretty=format:"%h %s" --graph
```

#### Get a more compact log
```
git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s"
```
#### Get a shorter status
```
git status -s
```
#### Checkout a pull request locally
```
git fetch origin pull/<id>/head:<branch>
git checkout <branch>
```

#### List the commits that involve a specific file
```
git log --follow -- <filename>
```

#### List the commits that involve a specific file, including the commits content
```
git log --follow -p -- <filename>
```

#### List the repository contributors ordering by the number of commits
```
git shortlog -s -n
```

#### Undo the last commit you pushed to the remote
```
git revert -n HEAD
```

#### Pick every change you havenâ€™t already committed and create a new branch
```
git checkout -b <branch>
```
#### Stop tracking a file, but keep it in the file system
```
git rm -r --cached
```
#### Get the name of the branch where a specific commit was made
